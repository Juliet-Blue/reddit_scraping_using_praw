# Reddit_scraping
A script to scrape posts and comments from any subreddit from reddit using python without losing the structure.

This script allows a user to scrape text, images, links etc from reddit using the praw API(Python reddit api).One difficult thing which a person can face while scraping such data is maintaing the structure(since the comments on reddit are nested). 
Hence in such a case we use different id's(post Id's and commentId's to preserve the structure)
